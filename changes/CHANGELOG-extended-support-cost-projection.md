# What's new in Extended Support Cost Projection

## Extended Support Cost Projection - v5.2.3

If you have modified the Extended Support Cost Projection dashboard visuals, these changes will be overridden when the dashboard is updated. Consider backing-up the existing dashboard by creating an analysis from it if you want to keep a reference to customised visuals so you can re-apply them after the update takes place.

To update run these commands in your CloudShell (recommended) or other terminal:

```
python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
pip3 install --upgrade cid-cmd
cid-cmd update --dashboard-id extended-support-cost-projection
```

- Added estimated cost column to the top details table in RDS, EKS, OpenSearch, and ElastiCache sheets. The value reflects the current pricing period (Year 1-2 or Year 3) estimated cost for each resource.
- Added new KPI visuals below each existing date range bucket (3, 6, 12 months, and beyond) in all four service sheets, showing the aggregated estimated cost for resources within each time horizon.

## Extended Support Cost Projection - v5.2.2

**Important:** This version updates the definition of the ElastiCache view for the Extended Support dashboard. A forced and recursive update is required to pick up the changes.

If you have modified the Extended Support Cost Projection dashboard visuals, these changes will be overridden when the dashboard is updated. Consider backing-up the existing dashboard by creating an analysis from it if you want to keep a reference to customised visuals so you can re-apply them after the update takes place.

To update run these commands in your CloudShell (recommended) or other terminal:

```
python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
pip3 install --upgrade cid-cmd
cid-cmd update --dashboard-id extended-support-cost-projection --force --recursive
```

- Fixed missing `product['cache_engine']` dependency declaration in the `elasticache_extended_support_view`. This ensures CUR1 users have `product_cache_engine` included in the `cur2_proxy` MAP expression, preventing query failures when the view filters on `product['cache_engine'] = 'Redis'`.

## Extended Support Cost Projection - v5.2.1

**Important:** This version updates the tagging view Athena query and the tagging view dataset definition. A forced and recursive update is required to pick up the changes.

To update run these commands in your CloudShell (recommended) or other terminal:

```
python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
pip3 install --upgrade cid-cmd
cid-cmd update --dashboard-id extended-support-cost-projection --force --recursive
```

- Joined `account_map` to the `extended_support_tagging_view` dataset so account-level taxonomy fields (e.g. OU columns) are carried through to the tagging dataset. This enables them to be included in the taxonomy candidate list during `cid-cmd` install/update, alongside the four resource datasets that already join `account_map`.
- Added `line_item_usage_account_id` to the tagging Athena view so the dataset-level join has a matching key.

## Extended Support Cost Projection - v5.2.0

**Important:** This version requires the data collection version 3.2.0+. Update to this version requires a forced update. Since this is a major version upgrade, the `cid-cmd` tool will ask to confirm a recursive update or not. Please make sure to confirm the recursive update by answering **yes** to continue the update process and have the view queries and datasets updated.

```

- Moved account name resolution from Athena view queries to QuickSight dataset joins for RDS, EKS, OpenSearch, and ElastiCache datasets. This improves reliability by sourcing account names directly from the `account_map` table via a LEFT JOIN at the dataset level, avoiding dependency on the join being present in the underlying Athena views.
- Fixed visual field references for account name across RDS, EKS, OpenSearch, and ElastiCache sheets to reflect the updated dataset join structure.
- Minor visual adjustments: removed axis offsets and scrollbar range constraints on usage breakdown charts.

## Extended Support Cost Projection - v5.1.0

- Redesigned RDS, EKS, OpenSearch and Elasticache sheets layout: consolidated visuals and updated positions.
- Replaced pie chart with a stacked bar chart showing hours of usage grouped by a dynamic dimension.
- Added "Group By" parameter control allowing users to switch between Account and Engine Version and selected tags groupings across usage visuals.
- Replaced static per-account and per-version breakdown charts with a dynamic timeline and a horizontal bar visual with cross-filtering support.
- Added subtitle context ("Based on last 30 days of usage") to cost breakdown and estimated cost visuals.

- Added taxonomy (tagging) support, enabling tag-based cost analysis and filtering across all Extended Support sheets.
- New tagging view and dataset for tag aggregation by service dimensions.
- Existing RDS, EKS, OpenSearch and ElastiCache views now include tag data for use with taxonomy controls.

New individual parameters and controls are now defined for RDS engine and engine version, EKS cluster version, and OpenSearch engine version. Filters on each sheet are associated to their new corresponding parameters.
